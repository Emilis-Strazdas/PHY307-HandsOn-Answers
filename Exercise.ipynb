    "## PHY307 - data analysis exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will analyze data recorded by the Compact muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n",
    "In 2012, after two years of data taking, the ATLAS and CMS experiments reported the observation of a new particle with a mass around 125 GeV, later established to be the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson, when produced in a high energy collision, decays almost immediately into other particles. One of the main decay channels used to establish the existence of the Higgs boson is the decay to a pair of Z bosons, which themselves decay to pairs of electrons or muons. This is a very clean signature, and one can see the visible peak in the four-lepton invariant mass distribution caused by the Higgs boson:\n",

    "\n",
    "This plot has a few key features that we will aim to reproduce:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The actual data is shown by the black markers - each point corresponds to the number of events observed with invariant mass in the given bin\n",
    " - The solid histograms are our expectation, derived using simulated events (\"Monte Carlo simulation\").\n",
    " - There are three histograms, stacked on top of each other, corresponding to three processes:\n",
    "   - In green, Z+X, the production of a single Z boson plus possible additional hadronic jets. This is a small background, and we will neglect it in this exercise.\n",
    "   - In blue, the ZZ background - this includes all the Feynman diagrams with the production of two Z bosons without involving the Higgs boson - this is going to be the main background process to our signal.\n",
    "   - In red, the Higgs boson signal according to the standard model predictions for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV.\n",
    "  \n",
    "An example Feynman diagram for the signal, and two possible diagrams for the ZZ background are given below:\n",

    "\n",
    "As we will see, the ZZ background is not the only one we have to worry about. It covers the contribution where all four leptons are what we call \"prompt\" - i.e. produced in isolation from the decay of a vector boson. There will also be a contribution from events with \"non-prompt\" leptons, either mis-identified \"fake\" leptons, or real leptons produced from semi-leptonic meson decays within \"jets\" of hadronic particles.\n",

    "Given we are looking for evidence of a new particle decaying to four muons, it isn't surprising that the invariant mass of the four-muon system will be a particularly powerful discriminator. Given the pt, eta, phi and mass of each muon, you could code up some formulae to convert these to (E, px, py, pz) vectors, then perform a sum over the muons to give the four-momentum of the system, from which you could calculate the invariant mass. This would be rather tedious, however, so instead we will make use of the `vector` module we imported earlier, to group the (pt,eta,phi,mass) variables into four-momentum objects that give us a lot of useful functions, and the ability to do things like add two vectors together."

As hinted at the start, there is another source of background for which we don't have a sample of simulated events. These are events where the muons are non-prompt. The proton-proton collisions of the LHC are extremely dominated by strong force interactions, and collisions producing jets of particles from the hadronization of quarks and gluons occur at a much higher rate than electroweak processes such as Higgs boson and ZZ production. What we are seeing here are mostly muons being produced from the semi-leptonic decays of mesons within these jets. Luckily, we have have a way of mostly removing this background: isolation. A key difference is that these muons are typically accompanied by other nearby particles in the jet, as in the sketch below. \n",

What could we do to improve the situation? Firstly, analyze more data - improve the statistical power of our measurement. Here we have only used a small fraction of the data delivered by the LHC. We should also consider Z boson decays to electron-positron pairs, and include the $ZZ \\rightarrow 2e2\\mu$ and $ZZ \\rightarrow 4e$ channels (bonus question: what about $Z \\rightarrow \\tau\\tau$ decays?). On top of that, we can also improve the signal-to-background ratio by further optimizing the analysis selection, and by constructing more powerful (multivariate) discriminators.\n",
